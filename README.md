# GOODS-TRADING-SYSTEM
This is a c++ based project using concept of OOPS(Object Oriented Programming system). 
It evaluates the expenses of exporting goods based on exporting goods from 
one continent to another , within country and on the basis of modes of transportation used.
It also assess the parameters like weight, type etc. of product to decide whether product can be transported or not etc. 
This project does not features any kind of UI for users as this was my first year project 
but I will integrate UI features in near future.
Using seperate header(.h) and Implementationfile(.cpp) for each class of
objects based on UML class diagram used during the project Design and structuring.
